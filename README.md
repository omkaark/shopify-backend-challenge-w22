## Getting Started

1. Visit this link if you are already not on the repl - https://replit.com/@OmkaarTheGreat/shopify-backend-challenge-w22
2. Click the "Open Website" button (sidenote: replit is insanely powerful wow)
3. The website should load and you should see 2 buttons followed by a table with some dummy values, a button and another table
4. Feel free to play around with these buttons and the application. My backend has basic CRUD functionality and also lets you create new Shipments
